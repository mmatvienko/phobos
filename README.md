Have finished monte carlo & historical VaR. Seems to be working fine, but I am not sure how to test. The move now is add local data caching to avoid multiple calls to the API (and also when testing, I can avoid getting different random data everytime). 
I'd also like to implement some sort of plot to see how VaR is calculated relative to portfolio holdings.
