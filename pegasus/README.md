# Pegasus
Breaking away from the astronomical object naming convention, this component was named pegasus because it will contain all the runners and running related code.

Most likely this will include strategies. The actual runner files will definitely be inluded - they they will be reponsible for intsantiating threads and running strategies. These strategies will call to *Titan* for help with modeling etc.
